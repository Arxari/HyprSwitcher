### A GTK4 utility to find and switch between launched apps on Hyprland

### Controls
1. When launched you automatically enter search
2. To get out of search press the down arrow and you will start to select the apps below
3. You can move through the listed apps with the up and down arrow keys
4. To get back to the search just go to the top with the up arrow

### Customization
The CSS file is located ~/.config/HyprSwitcher/style.css
By default HyprSwitcher comes with a nice looking (in my opinion) theme, this has the benefit of serving as a guide on how and what to change to style it to your liking.

Hope you like it :3
